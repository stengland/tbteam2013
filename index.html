              <div class="description">
                <p>Virginie is mum to two inquisitive pre-schoolers, Hannah (5) and
                  Constance (2). Hannah’s favourite game is to pretend she’s a robot;
                  Constance’s passion in life is to experiment with gravity. With two
                  girls, there’s no end of giggles in the house.</p>
                <p>Virginie started her career in investment banking, where she gained a
                  deep understanding of spreadsheets and how to work effectively with a
                  minimum amount of sleep. She then joined the Corporate Development
                  team at Yahoo! and worked on various projects ranging from
                  acquisitions to strategic partnerships across Europe. Most recently,
                  she was head of marketing at Keynoir, a luxury daily deal site.
                  Virginie loves making things and decided to launch toucanBox to share
                  her love of creating activities that spark kids imagination.</p>

                <p>Sara has been working in education for as long as she can
                  remember.  When her mother started a Montessori school more than
                  25 years ago, Sara spent many summers and afternoons after school
                  helping out in the classrooms.  She holds a degree in Early
                  Childhood Education and is a certified Early Childhood Montessori
                  Educator.  Sara spent over a decade as a lead teacher in a variety
                  of Montessori programs. For several years, Sara served as the
                  Director of the Reston Montessori School--a Montessori school of
                  over 250 students in Northern Virginia.  For the last seven years
                  Sara has also been a faculty member at the Institute of Advanced
                  Montessori Studies in Silver Spring, Maryland where she taught
                  cultural studies and helped to inspire others to pursue a career
                  in education. Since the beginning of 2012, Sara has been enjoying
                  living in London with her husband.</p>
                <p>Designing curriculum and educating children are Sara’s passions.
                  She is excited to be able to help parents and children learn and
                  have fun with the toucanBox projects every month!</p>

              <div class="job-title">Head of Operations</div>
              <div class="description">
                <p>Federica is from Reggio Emilia, a small town in northern Italy
                  known for its innovative, early-stage teaching methods. The goal
                  of Reggio's philosophy is to cultivate within children a lifelong
                  passion for learning and exploration. The ethos has certainly
                  rubbed-off on Federica whose natural curiosity led her to embark
                  on an international corporate career in both Europe and Asia,
                  where she established the Chinese operations for a leading
                  multi-national company.</p>
                <p>Education has always been the fulcrum to Federica’s ambitions and
                  she has obtained both a BA and MSc from Bocconi University in
                  Milan and a MBA from IMD, Switzerland. It was at IMD that Federica
                  met her husband and upon graduation, the two moved to London.
                  Federica joined toucanBox with the aim of getting her hands dirty
                  (literally); she manages the daily operations, overseeing the full
                  supply chain and buying process. To her great enjoyment, Federica
                  has also rediscovered her creative side testing all the innovative
                  toucanBox crafts: ‘the messier the better!’. “...a hundred worlds
                  to discover, a hundred worlds to invent, a  hundred worlds to
                  dream…” said Malaguzzi, founder of the Reggio-Emilia method.
                  Federica strongly believes that toucanBox helps children do
                  exactly that.</p>

                <p>Steve is Dad to Elisabeth(2) and has another little girl on the
                  way. Elisabeth’s favourite things are running, jumping and
                  PlayDoh. She also keeps Daddy in check and tells him when he has
                  been naughty. Soon to be outnumbered by girls Steve
                  is currently hatching plans for a “ManCave” at the bottom of the
                  Garden.</p>
                <p>Steve began his career as a “Web Designer” in the late nineties
                  when all you needed was a text editor and an FTP client. Over the
                  years he expanded is knowledge and skills to become an
                  accomplished developer and all round web nerd. In 2004 he and a
                  couple of like minded types formed Beef, a Creative Digital Agency
                  based in Bristol. Steve headed up the development team building
                  web apps that fulfilled the diverse needs of Beef’s client
                  base.</p>
                <p>Steve now leads the development team at toucanBox and lives to
                  make the toucanBox online experience as enjoyable the boxes
                  themselves.</p>
